#  Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

A simple yet powerful content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a selected title by analyzing metadata like overviews, genres, keywords, and cast. Built using Python, machine learning techniques, and deployed via Streamlit.

---


## üìå Features

-  Content-based filtering using TF-IDF & cosine similarity
-  Movie metadata analysis (overview, genre, cast, keywords)
-  High-quality movie posters fetched dynamically using OMDB API
-  Lightweight, fast, and responsive UI via Streamlit
-  Works without user history ‚Äì solves the cold start problem
-  Easily deployable as a web app

---

##  How It Works

1. User selects a movie from the list.
2. The system extracts its feature vector using TF-IDF (on metadata).
3. Cosine similarity is computed against all other movies.
4. Top similar movies are ranked and displayed with posters via OMDB.

##  Datasets Used

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
- credits.csv 
- keywords.csv
	
These can be sourced from: The Movie Dataset (TMDb) on Kaggle


‚úÖ Advantages

	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt rely on user history (great for new users)
 
	‚Ä¢	No collaborative filtering required
 
	‚Ä¢	Fast response time due to preprocessed models

‚ùå Limitations

	‚Ä¢	Can‚Äôt adapt to evolving user tastes over time
 
	‚Ä¢	Limited by available metadata (cold start for new movies)
 
	‚Ä¢	Less effective for highly subjective preferences
